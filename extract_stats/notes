The file that you download will be up to 3 megabytes, depending on the complexity of the terrain. The file name will begin with a "q" for decimeter files, or a "f" for files in vertical units of feet. These are .zip files which are combatible with pkunzip and winzip, and can also by unzipped with the public-domain unzip program now available on windows and most unix systems. In zip archive contains one file. For example q1010.zip unzips to q1010.dem. All unzipped files are more than 8 megabytes. They are in the venerable USGS ASCII DEM format, which most commercial and public domain packages can import.

gdaldem generally assumes that x, y and z units are identical.  If x (east-west)
  and y (north-south) units are identical, but z (elevation) units are different, the
  scale (-s) option can be used to set the ratio of vertical units to horizontal.  For 
  LatLong projections near the equator, where units of latitude and units of 
  longitude are similar, elevation (z) units can be converted to be compatible
  by using scale=370400 (if elevation is in feet) or scale=111120 (if elevation is in 
  meters).  For locations not near the equator, it would be best to reproject your
  grid using gdalwarp before using gdaldem.
